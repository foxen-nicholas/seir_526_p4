# Project 4 -  Be Excellent 2

For my Project 4 of my Software Immersive class, I have decided to recreate my Project 1 into a platformer using Unity. For my Project 1, I started making a game inspired by the upcoming Bill and Ted 3 and feel like it would be a fun learning experience to build it out in Unity now. I have always had a passion for video games and would love to learn how to create my own with the power of Unity! 

In the first iteration, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gameboard was created using canvas and learning how to add sprites and other objects sure was fun... This time I feel like I will be able to accomplish something closer to my original goal that I had with the first one.

I would like to create a basic platformer that sees Bill and Ted in an enviroment where they need to collect 3 items left in the level before a door opens to advance to the next level. Let's see how far close to this goal I can get!!

## Project Name, My Name, and Tech Used
*Be Excellent To Each Other II* 
*Nicholas Foxen*
*Unity (in C#)*

## Pre-Project Questions 
1. How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology? 
  Luckily, the whole Unity learning platform is available to anyone for free during the COVID-19 pandemic. I intend to explore the different courses they have available and also use the countless tutorials available to me on Youtube and elsewhere on the web.
2. What is your goal with this project? 
  To get a better understanding of how to create my own video games/animations in Unity while also learning the C# language. I knew going into this Immersive that I would want to explore Unity and C# after I had a coding foundation and how exciting is it that I get to for my Project 4.
3. Who is the user for your app?
  Anyone looking to take a break and have some fun with Bill and Ted on the adventure I am creating for them! Someone who likes games in early development and would like to see the progress of one as someone is learning.
4. Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into? 
  Not knowing the technology but I feel there are plenty of resources for me to tackle these roadblocks.
